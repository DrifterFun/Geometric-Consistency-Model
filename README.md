Synthetic Camera Simulator - Unreal Engine4 Plugin

Nowadays many pieces of research are based on synthetic images which can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/unrealcv/synthetic-computer-vision). This repository implements a pinhole camera model and lens-distortion model in UE4 based on [UnrealCV](https://github.com/miyosuda/unreal), which could be very useful for researchers working on Reinforcement learning,3D-Vision,SLAM,Robot navigation, so on.

The code will come soon.
